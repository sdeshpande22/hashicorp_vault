Hence, Effective planning, execution, and rigorous testing are essential for a smooth transition while adapting the system to meet specific business needs.

2) Technical Complications 
Implementing the new system on GCP brings challenges like system integration, API development, and performance optimisation. Ensuring stability, minimising downtime, and seamlessly integrating with legacy systems are key to a successful migration. Effective management of the GCP environment may adds complexity to the process.

3) Security and Compliance 
Compliance with HSBC’s stringent regulatory standards is very vital. Protecting sensitive customer data and adhering to global data protection regulations, such as GDPR, are critical. Non-compliance risks include financial penalties and reputational damage.Hence, Regular audits and alignment with internal security protocols are necessary.

4) Cost Management
Implementing the system on GCP requires careful cost management, including accurate forecasting and resource optimisation. Anticipating hidden costs, such as maintenance, and upgrades, is crucial. Establishing a robust budgeting process and regular reviews can help manage expenses effectively.

5) User Adaptation
