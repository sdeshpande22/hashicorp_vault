In the demo, we showcased an automated solution for extracting system performance metrics—specifically CPU usage, memory consumption, and filesystem statistics—from an InfluxDB instance using Flux queries integrated with Python. The process begins with the Python script leveraging the InfluxDB client library to securely connect to the database and execute targeted Flux queries for each metric type over defined time intervals. The retrieved data is parsed and efficiently structured using Pandas, which simplifies handling and transformation of the time-series data. To optimize performance and reduce execution time, multithreading was implemented, allowing concurrent extraction of multiple metric categories. Once the data is collected and processed, it is exported into well-structured CSV files, which are then automatically pushed to a designated NAS (Network Attached Storage) share. This enables seamless integration with the Athene performance monitoring tool, which consumes these CSV files for advanced visualization and analytics.
