Successfully updated the pytest automation pipeline to support asynchronous API requests, allowing the framework to handle concurrent API calls more efficiently. This enhancement has reduced the overall execution time for test suites and improved the scalability of the testing framework for future API integrations.

Collaborated with the Athene team on a high-impact initiative to extract performance data from InfluxDB. Designed and implemented a Python-based solution that generates CSV reports concurrently for multiple URLs using async programming techniques. This reduced the overall processing time and made the reporting system more responsive and reliable for real-time data extraction needs.

Completed structured learning in advanced SQL querying techniques, including complex joins, window functions, and CTEs to improve data transformation and reporting capabilities. Gained hands-on experience with the Pandas library for data wrangling and cleaning, and deepened knowledge in data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn to create insightful and presentation-ready plots and dashboards. Also explored time-series data querying using InfluxDB and asynchronous programming with asyncio and aiohttp for scalable data handling.

Earned the Enterprise Educate Programme 2024 completion certificate, a comprehensive internal learning initiative designed to strengthen both technical and managerial skills. This programme included modules on cross-functional collaboration, project planning, stakeholder communication, problem-solving, and technology deep-dives. Participation in this programme enhanced my ability to bridge the gap between technical delivery and strategic alignment, making me more effective in driving team and organizational goals.

Completed the PL-300: Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification, which equipped me with hands-on expertise in data preparation, modeling, visualization, and analysis using Power BI. The certification process also reinforced best practices in creating interactive dashboards and generating actionable business insights through effective data storytelling.
