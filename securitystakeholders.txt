When speaking with security stakeholders about a monolithic application, it's important to gather comprehensive information to understand the security posture, potential risks, and mitigation strategies. Here are several queries that can help in obtaining this information:

General Security Practices
Security Policies and Procedures:

What security policies and procedures are currently in place for the monolithic application?
How often are these policies reviewed and updated?
Compliance:

Which regulatory compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) does the application need to adhere to?
How is compliance monitored and maintained?
Application Security
Code Review and Testing:

How frequently are code reviews conducted for security vulnerabilities?
What kind of automated and manual security testing is performed (e.g., static code analysis, dynamic testing, penetration testing)?
Dependency Management:

How are third-party libraries and dependencies managed and monitored for vulnerabilities?
Secure Coding Practices:

What secure coding practices are followed by the development team?
Are there guidelines or checklists that developers adhere to for writing secure code?
Authentication and Authorization
User Authentication:

What authentication mechanisms are in place (e.g., single sign-on, multi-factor authentication)?
How are user credentials stored and protected?
Access Control:

How is access control managed within the application?
Are there role-based access controls (RBAC) or other access management frameworks implemented?
Data Security
Data Protection:

How is sensitive data encrypted both in transit and at rest?
What measures are in place to prevent data breaches and leaks?
Database Security:

What security measures are implemented to protect the database (e.g., encryption, access controls, monitoring)?
Infrastructure Security
Server and Network Security:

How are servers and network components secured?
What firewall and intrusion detection/prevention systems are in place?
Patch Management:

How are patches and updates managed for both the application and underlying infrastructure?
Incident Response and Monitoring
Incident Response Plan:

Is there an incident response plan in place? If so, what does it entail?
How are security incidents detected, reported, and resolved?
Monitoring and Logging:

What logging mechanisms are in place to monitor application activity and security events?
How is log data analyzed and retained?
Risk Management
Risk Assessment:

How often are security risk assessments conducted for the application?
What methodologies are used for risk assessment?
Threat Modeling:

Is threat modeling conducted for the application? If so, what tools and techniques are used?
Security Training and Awareness
Security Training:
What kind of security training is provided to developers and other stakeholders?
How is security awareness promoted within the organization?
Future Plans and Improvements
Security Roadmap:
Are there any planned security improvements or initiatives for the monolithic application?
How does the organization plan to address emerging security threats and vulnerabilities?
