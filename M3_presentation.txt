"When I overheard the conversation about the challenges of manual capacity planning, it struck me like a traffic jam on a busy highway. Just as congestion can slow down travel and lead to frustration, our current manual processes are creating bottlenecks in our workflow. We find ourselves stuck, spending valuable time on repetitive tasks rather than moving forward efficiently.

Imagine if we could develop a tool that acts like a GPS navigation system for our capacity planning. This tool would automate data collection, ensuring that we have a clear view of our capacity metrics at all times. With this real-time information, we could visualize trends just like a driver anticipating traffic patterns, allowing us to make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and when to take action.

Moreover, this tool would serve as a parking management system, helping us identify available 'spaces' in our capacity. By monitoring usage patterns, we could proactively address potential issues before they turn into a crisis, much like finding an open parking spot before it becomes crowded. In essence, automating our capacity planning would not only ease the flow of information but also reduce the risk of 'collisions' that arise from manual errors, leading us to a smoother, more efficient operation."
