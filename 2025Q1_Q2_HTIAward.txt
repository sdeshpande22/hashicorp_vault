4. SSRS to Splunk Integration â€“ CSV Report Automation [Final Stage]
Developed a solution using Python and PowerShell to:

Extract tabular reports from the SSRS portal using the SOAP API.

Convert the data into clean CSV format.

Push CSV files to Splunk for centralized monitoring and analysis.

Development is complete. Only final testing and scheduling via Windows Task Scheduler are pending for full deployment. This automation will eliminate manual SSRS report handling and ensure consistent ingestion into the Splunk ecosystem.
