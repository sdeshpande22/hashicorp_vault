1. Pytest API Testing Automation – Now Supports Async Requests
I designed and implemented a scalable and reusable API testing automation framework using Pytest, which now includes support for asynchronous request execution using httpx and pytest-asyncio. Key outcomes:

Enabled end-to-end testing of APIs that return responses concurrently or stream data, thus improving compatibility with modern microservice architectures.

Reduced test suite execution time by approximately 40% in services with high I/O-bound APIs.

Simplified debugging and reporting through structured test case definitions, parameterization, and reusable test configurations.

This enhancement significantly boosts CI/CD test coverage and agility for API-driven platforms.

2. Athene Metrics Automation – InfluxDB to Athene Integration
Built a Python-based automation solution for Athene, focused on gathering system performance metrics and automating their ingestion into the tool:

Extracted key system metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, and filesystem utilization) from InfluxDB for 7 monitored hosts using efficient Flux queries.

Utilized multi-threading to parallelize the extraction and CSV generation process, drastically reducing the processing time from ~2 hours to ~20 minutes for a full day’s (24-hour) worth of data.

Developed logic to generate well-structured CSV files, which are then automatically pushed to a pre-defined Athene NFS share.

This data is now directly consumed by the Athene tool for alerting, visualization, and predictive analytics, contributing to improved system reliability and proactive operations.

3. Enterprise Educate Program (EEP 2024) Completion – PL-300 Certified
As part of my continuous learning and development goals, I successfully completed the Enterprise Educate Program 2024 and earned the PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification.

Gained proficiency in data modeling, cleansing, and advanced DAX functions.

Built dashboards and reports that help in deriving actionable insights from enterprise datasets.

Applied these skills internally to generate better visibility into operations and enhance reporting automation.
