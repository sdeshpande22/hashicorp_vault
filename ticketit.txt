Understanding the Scope
Before diving into the design, it's crucial to define the scope of the ticketing system. This includes:

Target Users: Who will be using the system (internal employees, customers, partners)?
Issue Types: What kinds of issues will be tracked (technical, customer service, process-related)?
Workflow: What is the expected process for issue resolution (assignment, escalation, resolution)?
Integration: Will the system integrate with other systems (CRM, help desk, project management)?
